### TODO list
- Organize the testing code and add more tests 
- Improve the documentation
- Remove code redundancy by wrapping affine operations on the control points (bspline) and tensor products (bsplinebasis)
- Improve constructors of BSpline
- Implement save/load functionality for rbfsplines
- Implement support for scattered data interpolation with B-Splines (look into MBA algorithm)
- Implement NURBS
- Implement Hessian for radial basis function splines
- Test Jacobian for radial basis function splines
- Implement a proper preconditioning matrix for radial basis function weight computation
- Implement Kriging interpolation
- Test executable runtime speed on different compilers
- Investigate integrated B-splines and tension B-splines: http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~modersit/Pubs/2009-SPIE-BFM.pdf
- Fix evalHessian returning the wrong value when using Quadratic B-splines (also investigate if the issue exists elsewhere).
- Update documentation to reflect that we also have a MatLab interface
- Implement set operations for DataTable objects (set summation as union and set subtraction as relative complement)
- Consider creating a class for interpolating B-splines
- Implement functionality for appraising approximation errors
- Complete and test implementation of ordinary least squares
